- support a component model (like TypedActors++) with Spring

 @Actor
 public class MyActor {

    @Receive   // each method annotated with @Receive should be an Akka handler
    public void handleOrders(@Payload Order order ){
        // ...
    }

    @Receive
    public void handleOrders (@Payload Object allMessages ){
        // ...
    }

    @Autowired private ActorContext context ; // actor-local reference (a proxy)

    @Transactional // this uses Akka's transactors to *transactionally* receive or send messages
    @Receive
    public void handleReceive( @Context ActorContext context , @Payload Order order ){
        // ...
    }

    @Receive
    public void handleReceive(@Self ActorRef selfReference, @Payload Order order ) { }


 }

- We should have a way to configure Akka as the configuration file permits using a Spring XML namespace
- look into a Spring Integration adapter
- look into what a Spring Integration Akka mailbox looks like
